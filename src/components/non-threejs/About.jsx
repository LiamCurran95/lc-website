			<h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
			<p>
				After graduating from The University of Manchester in 2019 I began my
				career as an Environmental Planner; I enjoyed aspects of the job but I
				could tell that it wasn't something I was truly passionate about.
				<br></br>
				<br></br> The elements of the job that I did find most engaging were
				using technological tools to enhance and improve my workflow, be it
				automating Excel tasks with VBA, finding more efficient ways to trawl
				through the unorganised mess that is local government planning portals,
				or making interactive digital maps.
				<br></br> <br></br>I have always had an interest in computers and
				programming in general and have dabbled with a Raspberry Pi to emulate
				classic games (don't tell Nintendo), built computers for myself, friends
				and family, and just generally enjoy tinkering and problem solving -
				which seemed to tie up with the skills mentioned in the targeted ads I
				was constantly receiving telling me I should 'Join a Software
				Development bootcamp', so I started looking! <br></br>
				<br></br>I began learning Ruby and Python with Codecademy and
				freecodecamp, not wanting to commit to a career change without knowing
				that I was going to be invested I said that if I could still be
				interested in learning to programme after working my regular job then it
				was the right thing for me. After a few months of learning I began to
				research coding bootcamps, and by December 2021 I got accepted by
				Northcoders to undertake a Software Development bootcamp with the
				backing of an Excellence Scholarship.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>Since then I've really enjoyed getting stuck in with
				JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, APIs, three.js, and quite frankly a huge
				amount of other tech that the great tutors at Northcoders directed us
				towards, as well as the tools that I've discovered for myself in that
				time period, and I'm looking forwards to continuing to improve my
				personal knowledge.
